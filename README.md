**Simulated Web Server**

swebserv is piece of software that simulates [Denial-of-service
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on simulated
HTTP/web servers.

This project is heavily based on concepts and code from [Alan
Kaminsky](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ark/)'s book [Simulation
Simplified](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ark/ss/) (See Chapter 17, A DOS Attack).

The following people were involved in the design and implementation:

- [Pedro Ivan Lopez](http://pedroivanlopez.com)
- Raul Alejandro Cortes Trevi√±o
- Carlos Alberto Zarate Becerra
